What is batch wise costing and application 
in PPVC along the lines of ISO 22000 2018

There is a strong and practical connection between batch-wise costing and the Performance Planning Value Chain (PPVC) — especially in cold chain businesses that follow ISO 22000:2018, HACCP, and FSSC 22000 standards. Batch-wise costing not only tracks financial performance but also strengthens traceability, compliance, and risk-based decision-making.

How Batch-Wise Costing Supports PPVC Stages in Cold Chain

 1.Strategic Intent

In this phase, you define clear goals for both food safety and operational efficiency. For example, you might aim to reduce cost per safe batch, improve SKU-level transparency, or set a strategic KPI such as “reduce wastage-driven costs per batch by 20%.” This blends financial and safety goals, which is core to ISO/FSSC frameworks.

2. Strategic Alignment

Here, you translate food safety controls into measurable KPIs tied to cost structure. For instance, you can assign costs to specific steps like chilling, QA hold, or recall preparedness. By calculating the cost-per-CCP (Critical Control Point) or cost-per-deviation, you create a business case for investing in automation tools like metal detectors or cold room sensors.

3. Performance Planning

At the planning stage, embed batch-wise costing into each food safety checkpoint such as pre-chilling, marination, or vacuum sealing. For example, chilling may cost ₹3/kg, sealing ₹5/kg, and QA hold ₹0.5/kg. This aligns with ISO 22000 Clause 8.3 on traceability. You also link these cost checkpoints to barcode/QR code traceability systems and SOP documentation.

4. Performance Deployment

Train your cold chain teams — including pickers, QA staff, and van loaders — to understand the cost impact of non-compliance. For instance, if a batch is improperly sealed or mislabeled, the rework cost can be calculated and shown on the dashboard. This makes the cost of food safety failure tangible, helping build a stronger food safety culture across the organization.

5. Performance Monitoring

Use real-time tools like IoT, Power BI, and ERP dashboards to monitor temperature logs, non-conformances, and cost metrics. This stage focuses on KPIs such as:
	•Cost of spoiled/discarded batches
	•Cost per successful delivery batch
	•Cold room electricity cost per batch
These analytics help move from reactive HACCP checks to preventive performance monitoring.

6. Performance Review

During weekly or monthly reviews, identify high-cost batches that correlate with CCP failures, logistics inefficiencies, or product returns. For example, a review might reveal that “Top 3 batch-level deviations added ₹1.2 lakh/month in lost value.” These insights support ISO 22000 Clause 9.3 management review and Clause 10.1–10.2 corrective actions.

7. Learning & Improvement

Analyze batch costing trends to prioritize root causes — like seal failures, refreezing due to van delay, or incorrect dry ice loading. Use this data to upgrade SOPs, retrain teams, and justify CAPA (Corrective Action Preventive Action). You can now ask:
“Which CCP or PRP step is driving my cost overruns?”
The answer could be poor allergen zoning, manual sealing, or late dispatch.

Batch-Wise Costing: AI-Enabling Cold Chain KPIs

Here are some KPIs enhanced by batch-level costing and digital tools:
	•Cost per batch (₹/kg): Helps benchmark SKU-level efficiency.
	•Cost of rework (%): Connects directly to HACCP failure rates.
	•Cost of non-conformance: Captures the monetary value of spoiled stock.
	•Energy cost per batch: Points to refrigeration or reefer van inefficiency.
	•CAPA implementation cost: Quantifies investments in preventive fixes and automation.

Enablers of Batch-Wise Costing in PPVC (AI-ready tools)
	•Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (ERP): Automates batch costing, traceability, non-conformance tagging.
	•Power BI: Visualizes batch profitability, food safety KPIs, energy usage trends.
	•Barcode and QR systems: Enables end-to-end traceability from inbound RM to last-mile delivery.
	•Excel costing templates: Useful for small cold chains to track cost per CCP step manually (e.g., chilling, packing, QA hold).


Batch-wise costing closes the loop 
between finance, compliance, and food safety.
It allows cold chain businesses to move from 
reactive audits to proactive, AI-enabled 
decision-making. When integrated with PPVC 
and ISO/FSSC frameworks, it empowers cost-
effective, risk-based, and improvement-driven 
operations — a must-have for modern dairy, 
seafood, and frozen category leaders.
