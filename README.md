What is batch wise costing and application 
in PPVC along the lines of ISO 22000 2018

There is a strong and practical connection between batch-wise costing and the Performance Planning Value Chain (PPVC) — especially in cold chain businesses that follow ISO 22000:2018, HACCP, and FSSC 22000 standards. Batch-wise costing not only tracks financial performance but also strengthens traceability, compliance, and risk-based decision-making.

How Batch-Wise Costing Supports PPVC Stages in Cold Chain

 1.Strategic Intent

In this phase, you define clear goals for both food safety and operational efficiency. For example, you might aim to reduce cost per safe batch, improve SKU-level transparency, or set a strategic KPI such as “reduce wastage-driven costs per batch by 20%.” This blends financial and safety goals, which is core to ISO/FSSC frameworks.

2. Strategic Alignment

Here, you translate food safety controls into measurable KPIs tied to cost structure. For instance, you can assign costs to specific steps like chilling, QA hold, or recall preparedness. By calculating the cost-per-CCP (Critical Control Point) or cost-per-deviation, you create a business case for investing in automation tools like metal detectors or cold room sensors.

3. Performance Planning

At the planning stage, embed batch-wise costing into each food safety checkpoint such as pre-chilling, marination, or vacuum sealing. For example, chilling may cost ₹3/kg, sealing ₹5/kg, and QA hold ₹0.5/kg. This aligns with ISO 22000 Clause 8.3 on traceability. You also link these cost checkpoints to barcode/QR code traceability systems and SOP documentation.

4. Performance Deployment

Train your cold chain teams — including pickers, QA staff, and van loaders — to understand the cost impact of non-compliance. For instance, if a batch is improperly sealed or mislabeled, the rework cost can be calculated and shown on the dashboard. This makes the cost of food safety failure tangible, helping build a stronger food safety culture across the organization.

5. Performance Monitoring

Use real-time tools like IoT, Power BI, and ERP dashboards to monitor temperature logs, non-conformances, and cost metrics. This stage focuses on KPIs such as:
	•Cost of spoiled/discarded batches
	•Cost per successful delivery batch
	•Cold room electricity cost per batch
These analytics help move from reactive HACCP checks to preventive performance monitoring.

6. Performance Review

During weekly or monthly reviews, identify high-cost batches that correlate with CCP failures, logistics inefficiencies, or product returns. For example, a review might reveal that “Top 3 batch-level deviations added ₹1.2 lakh/month in lost value.” These insights support ISO 22000 Clause 9.3 management review and Clause 10.1–10.2 corrective actions.

7. Learning & Improvement

Analyze batch costing trends to prioritize root causes — like seal failures, refreezing due to van delay, or incorrect dry ice loading. Use this data to upgrade SOPs, retrain teams, and justify CAPA (Corrective Action Preventive Action). You can now ask:
“Which CCP or PRP step is driving my cost overruns?”
The answer could be poor allergen zoning, manual sealing, or late dispatch.

Batch-Wise Costing: AI-Enabling Cold Chain KPIs

Here are some KPIs enhanced by batch-level costing and digital tools:
	•Cost per batch (₹/kg): Helps benchmark SKU-level efficiency.
	•Cost of rework (%): Connects directly to HACCP failure rates.
	•Cost of non-conformance: Captures the monetary value of spoiled stock.
	•Energy cost per batch: Points to refrigeration or reefer van inefficiency.
	•CAPA implementation cost: Quantifies investments in preventive fixes and automation.

Enablers of Batch-Wise Costing in PPVC (AI-ready tools)
	•Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (ERP): Automates batch costing, traceability, non-conformance tagging.
	•Power BI: Visualizes batch profitability, food safety KPIs, energy usage trends.
	•Barcode and QR systems: Enables end-to-end traceability from inbound RM to last-mile delivery.
	•Excel costing templates: Useful for small cold chains to track cost per CCP step manually (e.g., chilling, packing, QA hold).


Batch-wise costing closes the loop 
between finance, compliance, and food safety.
It allows cold chain businesses to move from 
reactive audits to proactive, AI-enabled 
decision-making. When integrated with PPVC 
and ISO/FSSC frameworks, it empowers cost-
effective, risk-based, and improvement-driven 
operations — a must-have for modern dairy, 
seafood, and frozen category leaders.

how to make warehouse layout
Dealing with real cold chain layout decisions, we will be connecting the lane depth “D” decision directly.

COLD STORAGE LAYOUT ANALOGY (THE BASICS)

Imagine a warehouse region like a bookshelf:

Sure, here’s your warehouse-to-bookshelf analogy rewritten as simple text with AI-friendly keywords for embedding into prompts, semantic search, or classification:

Warehouse-to-Bookshelf Analogy for AI Context:

•Rows (D) in a warehouse are like vertical columns of shelves on a bookshelf.

•Lane depth (Y = y × D) is like the shelf depth—how far books are pushed back.

Each unit-load (x, y, z) is equivalent to a single book with width, depth, and height.

•Aisle space (A) corresponds to the walking space in front of the bookshelf.

•Stack height (H) is like the number of books stacked on top of each other.

WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO?

You want to store the maximum number of SKU units in a region (maximize cube utilization), but:

•If rows D are too few, each row is deep → honeycomb loss (some lanes only partly filled)

•If rows D are too many, more aisle space is needed → floor space gets wasted

So the magic number D is what you’re solving for.

3. EXAMPLE TO EXPLAIN FORMULA

Let’s say:

•Each pallet of cream cheese: x = 1m, y = 1.2m, z = 1m

•Stack height = 2 pallets (so H = 2)

•Aisle width A = 3m

•Storage area: X = 10m wide, Z = 2m tall

•SKU 1 has 60 pallets

•Try D = 2, D = 3, D = 4 to compare

Step-by-Step Breakdown (Randomized Storage)

Step 1: Number of Lanes, L(D)

If you have M = 60 pallets, and each lane can hold D × H pallets:

L(D) = M(D X H)

Example:
•If D = 2, H = 2 → L(2) = ⌈60 / (2×2)⌉ = 15 lanes
•If D = 3 → L(3) = ⌈60 / 6⌉ = 10 lanes

Step 2: Total Area (2D):

If:
	•x = unit load width (in meters)
	•y = unit load depth
	•A = aisle width
	•X = total storage width
	•L(D) = number of lanes (depends on D)

Then

Example (for D = 2):
•First part: 1m × 1.2m × 15 lanes = 18m²
•Aisle area: 0.5 × 3 × 10 = 15m²
•Total: TA(2) = 18 + 15 = 33 m²

Step 3: Cube Utilization (2D)

Original Formula

CU<>2D = Stack Area/ Total Area}} = x X y X (M/H)/TA(D)

Variables Explained
	•x = unit-load width
	•y = unit-load depth
	•M = total number of SKU    
        units
	•H = number of stack levels 
        (height)
	•M/H = number of full stacks 
        needed
	•TA(D) = total area (see 
        previous simplification)
	•Stack area: 1m × 1.2m × ⌈60 / 2⌉ = 36m²
	•CU(2D) = 36 / 33 ≈ 1.09 (109%)

Wait — a cube utilization above 1 isn’t possible in real layouts — this means the stacking area is overlapping (too much demand for too little area). So you adjust D again.

Try D = 3 and D = 4 similarly, and you’ll find one value where CU is below 1 but closest to 1 — that’s the optimal.

You’d just enter:
	•	Unit load dimensions
	•	Aisle width
	•	Max pallet count per SKU
	•	Stack height
	•	Try D = 1 to D = 6

And it would calculate CU and show a graph like this:

D      | L(D) | TA(D) | CU(2D)
-----|------|------ |--------
1       | 30     | 51      | 0.70
2       | 15     | 33     | 1.09 
3       | 10     | 27     | 0.89 
4      | 8       | 24     | 0.75

You are trying to balance lane depth (D) vs aisle space.
	•If D is too shallow, space is wasted.
	•If D is too deep, you get honeycomb loss (unused depth).
	•You calculate CU (cube utilization) at each D and choose the best.
